Today, I want to talk about the reason why I wanted to become a PhD. 

Hello, it is Jinyoung Ko, again. Until now, since I have finished various tasks from research, intro and outro video production for conferences: ISHVAC, and department homepage design, I was under a lot of burden. But, its okay, now. 

I am going to represent several reasons to pursue PhD, personally. 

#### Sharing ideas for the betterment of humankind is always extremely excited.
