Hi, there!

Nowadays, I have developed energy harvesting block to produce electricity from solar thermal energy and constructed experimental set-up. I made the set-up such as a refrigerator, a peltier plate, and data recorders with a laptop. 

I hope every thing will be okay during my experiments :smiley:
