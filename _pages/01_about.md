My name is **Jinyoung Ko**. I am currently a post-master researcher in Building Mechanical and Environmental Systems (BMES) laboratory, Hanyang University, South Korea, working with Professor Jae-Weon Jeong. At the same time, **I am preparing to study abroad** to research the most forefront issues in Built Environment and Building Energy. 

### Academic goal

My goal is to be a **hard-bitten researcher who can find the answer in any arduous environment**. Since I can learn and apply new things, I enjoy to confront challenges during research projects. Thus, I am willing to let myself undergo difficulties from familiar to completely unknown problems.  

### Research interests

Currently, I am interested in **data-driven and stochastic approaches <sup>1)</sup>to establish bottom-up Urban Building Energy Model, <sup>2)</sup>to predict human-building interaction for thermal comfort <sup>3)</sup>to develop promising HVAC systems**. Since I have experienced in energy performance analysis of building systems in both active and passive systems: heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and building-integrated renewable energy systems, deep understanding in fundamental building systems and thermodynamics will be my assets to expand my research capacity.
