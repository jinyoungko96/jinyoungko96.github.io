## <font size=3>Who Am I?

<font size=2>My name is <b>Jinyoung Ko</b>. I am currently a post-master researcher in Building Mechanical and Environmental Systems (BMES) laboratory, working with Professor Jae-Weon Jeong. At the same time, <b>I am preparing to study abroad</b> to study the most forefront issues in Built Environment and Building Energy domains. My personal goal is to provide a comfortable built environment without excessive energy consumption for humankind, also for the socially disadvantaged. </font>

## <font size=3>Personal goal

<font size=2> Working experience in a homeless shelter, the Vision Training Center, developed my personal goal to provide a comfortable built environment without excessive energy consumption for humankind, also for the socially disadvantaged. To achieve my goal for humanity, I will be an experienced researcher having a philanthropic perspective. </font>

## <font size=3>Academic goal

<font size=2>My goal is to be an <b>insightful researcher who can find the answer in any arduous environment</b>. Since I can learn and apply new things, I enjoy facing new challenges during research projects. </font>

### Research interests

- To establish efficient approaches from building scale model for bottom-up Urban Building Energy Modeling 

- To predict human-building interaction for individual thermal comfort

- To develop and evaluate the energy-saving potential of promising heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems

  Since I have experience in energy performance analysis of building systems in both active and passive systems: heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and building-integrated renewable energy systems, a deep understanding of fundamental building systems and thermodynamics will be my assets to expand my research capacity.
