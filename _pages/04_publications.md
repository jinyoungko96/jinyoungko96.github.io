     <font size=2>Owing to the economic recession due to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, energy-efficient building retrofitting has been considered as an integrated solution to recover the economy and maintain global greenhouse gas reduction. As part of retrofitting existing building-integrated photovoltaic systems <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/photovoltaic-system">photovoltaic systems</a> during building renovations, this study evaluated the energy generation potential of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/thermoelectrics">thermoelectric</a> generator-assisted building-integrated photovoltaic system with a phase change material. The combination of a thermoelectric generator and phase change material with photovoltaic systems results in solar cell temperature reduction and additional electricity output owing to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/seebeck-effect">Seebeck effect</a>, increasing the total generated energy from the system. Simulations of the proposed system were performed using MATLAB R2020a, based on transient <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/energy-balance-equation">energy balance equations</a>. The appropriate melting temperature and thickness of the phase change material were derived to maximize the annual electricity generation of the proposed system from simulations of 12 design days in each month. The proposed system with the selected phase change material conditions exhibited a 1.09% annual increase in generation output and 0.91%, −1.32%, 2.25%, and 3.16% generation improvements from spring to winter, compared with the building-integrated photovoltaic system alone. Theoretically, the proposed system is expected to generate 4.47% more energy by minimizing the thermal resistance of the system and improving thermoelectric generator performance.</font>

   - <font size=2><u>Abstract</u>:

     <font size=2>This study evaluates the energy-saving potential of a prediction model-based pre-heat coil operation method for frost prevention in energy recovery ventilators, compared to existing approaches. Energy recovery ventilator (ERV) requires pre-heating of the incoming outdoor air to prevent undesirable condensation and frost formation in the enthalpy exchanger during winter. Conventionally, the introduced outdoor air is pre-heated to a certain constant temperature using a pre-heat coil, resulting in unnecessary energy consumption. Maintaining a constant pre-heat temperature during the operation of the ERV is not ideal as the frost threshold temperature varies with the outdoor air temperature and humidity. Therefore, to reduce pre-heating energy consumption, a prediction model-based pre-heat coil operation method is proposed herein. A numerical model predicting the frost threshold temperature based on the outdoor air and exhaust air conditions was developed, and validated using the optimal Latin hypercube design method. Subsequently, a series of energy simulations was performed considering an identical residential model, located in 8 cities with different climatic conditions, to evaluate the energy-saving potential of the proposed pre-heat coil operation method compared to conventional methods. The proposed method consumed 7%–72% less energy in the ERV operation and required a 1%–21% smaller pre-heat coil capacity than the conventional method. Thus, the proposed operation method is superior to the conventional method as it prevents frost formation and consumes a minimal amount of energy. </font>

   - <font size=2><u>Abstract</u>:

     <font size=2>In this study, two workable designs of a heat-pump-driven liquid desiccant (HPLD) air-conditioning system were proposed for residential buildings. The proposed HPLD systems were designed to work as a multi-functional air-conditioning system without additional equipment which would solve the low practicality due to the large scale and complexity of the conventional liquid-desiccant-assisted air-conditioning system. The critical difference between the two systems is the sump design for containing the desiccant solutions: Case A has a single sump instantly mixing weak and strong solutions, whereas Case B has dual sumps containing weak and strong solutions separately. The thermal load of target space was estimated using TRNSYS 18, and energy performances of both HPLD systems for summer and winter operation modes were analyzed using EES by integrating several established models and theoretical analyses. Owing to decrease in solution cooling and heating loads, the results show that Case B, compared with Case A, saved 28% of energy consumption and improved mean energy-efficiency by 37.5% for summer operation mode, and saved 12% of energy consumption and improved mean energy-efficiency by 4.95% for winter operation mode. In conclusion, Case B has a better application potential for residences in terms of energy performance.</font>
